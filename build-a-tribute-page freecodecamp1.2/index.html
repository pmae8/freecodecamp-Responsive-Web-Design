                Dr. Norman Borlaug, an American agronomist, is known as the "Father of the Green Revolution" for his work in developing high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties. 
                His research and innovations significantly increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries, helping to avert famines and save millions of lives.
